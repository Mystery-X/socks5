h1. Usage

The socks5 library is distributed as a Tcl package and can be loaded using the 
@package require@ command:

<pre><code>package require socks5 0.1</code></pre>

h2. socks5::configure

Usage: @socks5::configure <args>@

Use @socks5::configure@ to configure the library for operations.  The following options
are available:

|_. Option |_. Description |
| @-proxy@ | IP or hostname for the proxy server |
| @-proxyport@ | Port number on which the proxy server operates (default: 1080) |
| @-bindtimeout@ | Timeout (in milliseconds) when waiting for an incoming connection via @socks5::bind@ |

Example:

<pre><code>socks5::configure -proxy localhost -proxyport 1080 -bindtimeout 2000</code></pre>

h2. socks5::connect

Usage: @socks5::connect <host> <port>@

Establishes a connection with a remote host through the configured proxy.

Example:

<pre><code>socks5::connect www.google.com 80</code></pre>

h2. socks5::bind

Usage: @socks5::bind <host> <port> <callback>@

Requests the proxy open a TCP port for listening and wait for an incoming connection
from the specified host and port.

The @callback@ parameter will be evaluated at the global scope when the incoming 
connection is established.  Two parameters will be appended.  The first indicates the
type of response from the proxy, while the second depends on the response.  The
following table identifies expected response codes.

|_. Response |_. Argument | _. Description |
| @ok@ | channel handle | Indicates an incoming connection was esablished. The channel handle may be used to communicate with the remote host. |
| @timeout@ | error message | Indicates the @-bindtimeout@ expired while waiting for an incoming connection. |
| @error@ | error message | Indicates some sort of error occurred with the proxy.  The error message provides further details. |

Example:

<pre><code>socks5::bind ftp.cdrom.com 21 handle_connect</code></pre>
